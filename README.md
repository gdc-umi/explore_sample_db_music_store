Data Science Independent Project #2 â€“ EXPLORING SAMPLE DATABASE - MUSIC STORE

This is an independent project posted in the Codecademy forum in regard to an off-platform challenge as a Data Scientist/Analyst. It is part of the Data Science and Data Analysis career path and something I found under the Learn SQL course.

I utilized the DB Browser for SQLite tool to complete this project and used the sample database from the forum. All the questions/challenges/tips are available in the link provided below.
